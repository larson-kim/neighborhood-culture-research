# Neighborhood Culture Research
Help neighborhoods understand their neighbors

## About the Study
St. Johns is a neighborhood located on a peninsula North Portland, Oregon with 12,898 residents (2020 census data). The City of Portland recognizes 94 neighborhood associations, as a means by “which the people of the City of Portland may effectively participate in civic affairs and work to improve the livability and character of their neighborhoods and the City” (Portland.gov). The average home price in the 97203 zip code at the time of the study was $453,586 compared to the City of Portland with the average home price identified as $524,870 (Zillow).

Membership for the St. Johns Neighborhood Association is open to “all residents 16 years of age and older, property owners, business licensees, and nonprofit organizations located (or performing a significant part of their services) within the boundaries of SJNA” (SJNA Bylaws) 

Common challenges to quantitative surveys include low response rates, survey fatigue, and stakeholders who are inclined to take proactive measures to skew the data in their favor. 

Focus groups can be swayed by charismatic personalities who drive the conversation, speaking over quieter more cautious participants. Focus groups are often limited in the number of people that can be included. 

The Luminoso Method utilized in this research study allows each respondent to share their experiences and perspectives in depth. 

## Survey Participant Recruitment
The tone of the survey and publicity was neighborly, warm, and thoughtful, which successfully encouraged people to reciprocate that energy in kind. Flyers created were improved upon iteratively and were supported by many local businesses. 

## Diversity, Equity, and Inclusivity intentions
Surveys were available in long and short form, in both English and Spanish. 

## Technology Barriers
Access was simple for neighbors with smart phones, so we partnered with FirstDoorPDX to host a survey-taking event, where participants could submit surveys in exchange for Bingo cards to win prizes. Laptops were provided by the local library, and volunteers assisted residents with technology assistance needs. 

## Events in the St. Johns Survey
On February 29, 2024, a new conversation sprung up that no one was expecting, and emotions immediately started to run high. 

The background of the Delta Park Bottle Drop location was known to residents, but not top of mind for the survey design initially. Some members of the community urged that the survey be closed, but Luminoso Daylight allowed SJNA to extend the survey fielding and capture the residents’ passionate concerns. 

The survey fielding period was extended as a consequence, allowing more neighbors could share their stories given the time constraints of the 1 hour SJNA meeting. 

The North Peninsula Review and the St. Johns Review are two local newspapers covering updates on Bottle Drop developments. 

## Community Development
The survey results were shared with the community on April 8, 2024 at the St. Johns Neighborhood Association general meeting in the Sitton Elementary School cafeteria. The SJNA April 8th presentation is publicly available, in addition to the March 11th presentation delivered to residents via newsletter following the Bottle Drop response meeting. 

## Supporting Economic Development
St. Johns Center for Opportunity seeks to fill empty storefronts in St. Johns with businesses that serve the community, centralizing equity and inclusivity, investing in underrepresented communities, and small businesses, particularly BIPOC and LGBTQ+ owned. The SJCO presentation is publicly available.  

## Small Businesses Respond
Wonderwood Springs, “a magical gathering place” created by Mike Bennett, a local artist and creator of ‘public joy’, introduced ice cream and mini golf, responding to the community’s request for 3rd spaces that children and families can enjoy.
